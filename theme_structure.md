# Theme structure

## Header

The header is the structure that traditionally sits at the top of a web page. 
It contains the title of the website. Template file: *header.php*

## Content

This container holds the *WordPress Loop*, that processes each post that will be displayed on the current page. 
These posts are then formatted according to how they match specific criteria within the *Loop tags*.
